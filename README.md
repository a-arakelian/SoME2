This repository stores codes for animation in [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/iv6RmcNojUk).
> NOTE: animations created with [manim](https://www.manim.community/) animation engine. Personally, the codes in this repository seem cluttered to me and they do not have an accepted code style. Long story short, I was not going to publish the codes, but at the request of the audience I do it.

The animation codes in the `mcodes` folder. Different scenes in different `.py` files. These files have names without much logic ðŸ˜›

**WARNING:** there are also codes for animations that are not included in the [final video](https://youtu.be/iv6RmcNojUk).
